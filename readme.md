This is a repository of android projects from the book Android Programing: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide 3rd edition. While the book project apps are coded with java and with not up-to-date android libraries i used kotlin and tried to use the most recent libraries.I am trying to reproduce the projects based mostly on the descriptions, so some code parts probably will be quite different.

I believe that reproduce this projects with kotlin and android jetpack will be a valuable experience that will allow me to work better in new and old systems.
